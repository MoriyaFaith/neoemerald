# Pokémon NEO Emerald

This is a ROM hack based on the [decompilation of Pokémon Emerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald).

It builds the following ROMs:

* **neoemerald.gba** - Main Game
* **neo_faithful.gba** - Alternate version featuring no changes to mechanics, Pokémon, or moves.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

For a full list of changes, [see here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LdYk7z0LjC0_sq5UZnbCyTw7Kma3EwDjELMec5gXRdg/edit?usp=sharing) (WIP)
