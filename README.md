# Pokémon NEO Emerald

This is a ROM hack based on the [decompilation of Pokémon Emerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald).

It changes the following:
* Updates overworld graphics to FRLG's style
* Changes the types, stats, and abilities of several Pokemon to increase the overall viability of Pokémon
* Trainer parties have been altered in order to increase difficulty
* Extra Trainers and areas have been added to the region
* Moves and Evolutions from Generation 4 have been added
* Increased Slot Machine Luck

It builds the following ROMs:

* **neoemerald.gba** - Main Game
* **neo_faithful.gba** - Alternate version featuring no changes to mechanics, Pokémon, or moves.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
